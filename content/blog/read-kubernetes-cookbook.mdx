The kubectl run command is called a generator; it is a convenience command to create a Pod object (see Recipe 4.4). The kubectl expose command is also a generator, a convenience command to create a Service object

kubectl is always configured to speak to a given Kubernetes cluster by default, and this configuration is part of something called the context.
