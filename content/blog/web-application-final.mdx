# Plan
Liu & Xie: Basically do the frontend, including writing css and build the template(without logic) of components

Wen & Qi: Basically do the logic and backend, including database, i18n support, and deploy to production

# UI, UX
“minimal” style

### User friendly
- multi-lingual support(i18n)
- dark/light mode support
- responsive design

---

# Technologies selected and used

Typescript: for type-safe

Next.js 13 Framework:
- using server components as default made its really fast

TailwindCSS: (responsive) css becomes easy

Database: use sqlite to save the comments

contentlayer: to parse the markdown file

Vercel Deployment: access the production build, anywhere, for free

We use GitHub for collaboration, you can find all commits and PRs there

---

# Code and error:
- The comment is not working on deployment because we use sqlite now in development and it is not supported by vercel
  - We will move to other database like vercel postgres or suspase
- We have a hydration runtime error when implementing multi-lingual support ( not influence the production build, only occurred in development side )
  - the error and warning don't affect the production build

---

# The future

- a search bar(easy)
- change sqlite to other db(normal)
- add animations, transitions to the site, by using tailwind CSS animations(normal)
- refactor the code
  - examine server/client components more carefully
  - we do have some inconsistence because collaboration, and it affect the code quality
- try more things in backed, maybe graphQL or something(hard)
