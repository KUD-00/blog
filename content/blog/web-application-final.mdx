# Introduction

We want to build a blog site, that can parse the markdown file to generate the static website.

Also, we want to try the new technologies about web development.

We built this on the basis of shadcn/taxonomy

---

# Work distribution
Liu & Xie: Basically do the frontend, including writing css and build the template(without logic) of components

Wen & Qi: Basically do the logic and backend, including database, i18n support, and deploy to production

---

# Installation and usage
you can access the production build on https://blog.rughzenhaide.com

### run on your own pc
prerequisites: better use pnpm than npm, we didn't try npm recently.

repo url: https://github.com/KUD-00/blog

- git clone
- pnpm install
- pnpm dev

then access localhost:3010(pay attention that is 3010 not 3000)

(we will put an tarball in the submitted zip file)

---

# UI, UX
“minimal” style: simple and decent

### User friendly
- multi-lingual support(i18n)
- dark/light mode support
- responsive design(for different devices)

---

# Technologies selected and used

Typescript: for type-safe

Next.js 13: using server components as default made it really fast

TailwindCSS & daisyUI: css becomes easy

// Database: use sqlite to save the comments (not working now)

contentlayer: to parse the markdown file

Vercel Deployment: access the production build, anywhere, for free

We use GitHub for collaboration, you can find all commits and PRs there

---

# Code and error:
- The comment is not working on deployment because we use sqlite now in development and it is not supported by vercel
  - We will move to other database like vercel postgres
- We have a hydration runtime error when implementing multi-lingual support ( not influence the production build, only occurred in development side )
  - the error and warning don't affect the production build

---

# The future

- a search bar(easy)
- change sqlite to other db(normal)
- add animations, transitions to the site, by using tailwind CSS animations(done)
- refactor the code
  - examine server/client components more carefully
  - we do have some inconsistence because collaboration, and it affect the code quality
- try more things in backend, maybe graphQL or something(hard)
